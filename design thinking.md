Provide a concise summary of what Herbert Simon says about Design Thinking.

Herbert Simon believes that science of a design is more than proffesional equivalent of and educaiton, but it is also a core 
discipline (Buchanan, 2010). He describes design as the knowledge that is in specific professions, for example, engineering, 
management or medicine (Kimbell, 2012). He identifies design as a rational set of prcedures which can respond to a defined 
problem. According to Herbert Simon “problem solving requires interpretation among state and procedure decriptions of a 
similar complex reality” (Simon, 1969)

Through referencing “The Cox Review of Creativity in Business”
(2005) - why does its 
author - Sir George Cox believe Design Thinking is so important?

He believes design thinking is significant. Despite of the fact that he believes, the key strategy for building capacity is 
not just about good looking of a design but is about how you get  this product in to market and how you position it. It is 
way of how you promote your product.
