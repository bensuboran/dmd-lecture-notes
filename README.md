I see creativity as a reflection of an imagination. It is actually not about what you but how you do. Creativity is something unique but you can share at the same time.

What is the significance of ‘the problem’ for digital media designers?

‘The problem’ is very significant for digital media designers, because this concept tends to be more practical instead of theorytical. Its about experiencing how things work or how things doesnt work, this is the reason why digital media design tends to focus on the problem of communicaitng information and and producing experinces.

What is the key to working effectively (individually and collaboratively)?

The key to working effectively is working in progress and being open minded. When you are working individually and collaboratively creating a plan and being organized can be very effective but being open for changes or any new ideas can be also effective at the same time because it can save you not to be stick in something and can be helpful moving forward easily.

What is design about?

Design is about creating something divergently, unique to its aim.

I found this part quite interesting, because at the begining I did not understand why we wrote like this, especially 56th line. However, when I learnt why we wrote this part like that İ understood the logic of it, therefore it made everything sense.
